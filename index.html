          <h3>What is Python?</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Python is a high-level, cross-platform, and open-sourced programming language released under a GPL-compatible license. Python Software Foundation (PSF), a non-profit organization, holds the copyright of Python.</p>
<p>Guido Van Rossum conceived Python in the late 1980s. It was released in 1991 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language. He named this language after a popular comedy show called 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' (and not after Python-the snake).</p>
<p>In the last few years, its popularity has increased immensely. According to stackoverflow.com's recent survey, Python is in the top three Most Loved Programming Language in 2020.</p>
<h4>Python Features:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Python is an interpreter-based language, which allows the execution of one instruction at a time.</li>
  <li>Extensive basic data types are supported e.g., numbers (floating point, complex, and unlimited-length long integers), strings (both ASCII and Unicode), lists, and dictionaries.</li>
  <li>Variables can be strongly typed as well as dynamic typed.</li>
  <li>Supports object-oriented programming concepts such as class, inheritance, objects, module, namespace etc.</li>
  <li>Cleaner exception handling support.</li>
  <li>Supports automatic memory management.</li>
  <li>Various built-in and third-party modules, which can be imported and used independently in the Python application.</li>
  </ul>

          <h3>Where to use Python?</h3>
          </header>
 <p>Even though Python started as a general-purpose programming language with no particular application as its focus, it has emerged as the language of choice for developers in some application areas over the last few years. Some important applications of Python are summarized below:</p>
          <h4>Data Science</h4>
<p>Python experienced a recent emergence in popularity charts, mainly because of its Data science libraries. A huge amount of data is being generated today by web applications, mobile applications, and other devices. Companies need business insights from this data.<p>
<p>Today Python has become the language of choice for data scientists. Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib are extensively used in the process of data analysis, including the collection, processing and cleansing of data sets, applying mathematical algorithms, and generating visualizations for the benefit of users. Commercial and community Python distributions by third-parties such as Anaconda and ActiveState provide all the essential libraries required for data science.</p>
          <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
<p>This is another key application area of Python. Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, Tensorflow and NLTK are widely used for the prediction of trends like customer satisfaction, projected values of stocks, etc. Some of the real-world applications of machine learning include medical diagnosis, statistical arbitrage, basket analysis, sales prediction, etc.</p>
          <h4>Web Development</h4>
<p>Today, most of the web servers are compatible with WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) - a specification for the universal interface between Python web frameworks and web servers. All leading web servers such as Apache, IIS, Nginxetc can now host Python web applications. Google's App Engine hosts web applications built with almost all Python web frameworks.</p>

          <h3>Python Version History</h3>
          </header>
<p>Python Software Foundation (PSF) used to support two major versions, Python 2.x & Python 3.x. PSF supported Python 2 because a large body of existing code could not be forward ported to Python 3. So, they supported Python 2 until January 2020, but now they have stopped supporting it.</p>
<p>Python 3.0 was released on December 3rd, 2008. It was designed to rectify certain flaws in the earlier version. This version is not completely backward-compatible with previous versions. However, many of its major features have since been back-ported to the Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3 include utilities to facilitate the automation of Python 2 code translation to Python 3.</p>

          <h3>Python Data Types</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. Python supports the following built-in data types.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>int: Positive or negative whole numbers (without a fractional part) e.g. -10, 10, 456, 4654654.</li>
            <li>float: Any real number with a floating-point representation in which a fractional component is denoted by a decimal symbol or scientific notation e.g. 1.23, 3.4556789e2.</li>
            <li>complex: A number with a real and imaginary component represented as <code>x + 2y</code>.</li>
            <li>bool: Data with one of two built-in values <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. Notice that 'T' and 'F' are capital. <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are not valid booleans and Python will throw an error for them</li>
            <li>None: The <code>None</code> represents the null object in Python. A <code>None</code> is returned by functions that don't explicitly return a value.</li>
            </ul>
